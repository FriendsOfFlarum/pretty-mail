A [Flarum](http://flarum.org) extension. Make custom HTML templates for emails!

- Configure your custom email template from the extension settings
- This supports all emails sent by Flarum, and 3rd party extensions

### Installation

Use [Bazaar](https://discuss.flarum.org/d/5151-flagrow-bazaar-the-extension-marketplace) or install manually with composer:

```sh
composer require fof/pretty-mail
```

### Updating

```sh

### Important Note 

Due to how Flarum handles certain emails, I had to utilize a "hack" to get it to work. Please report any issues you have to our Github.
